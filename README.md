## My experiences

 🕴🏻 During my time at [the UTC](https://github.com/UTCSheffield) I have been able to spend time with various employers such as [Symantec](https://github.com/Symantec), [Sky Betting and Gaming](https://github.com/skybet), [Raytheon (Cyber Security Divison)](https://www.raytheon.com/uk), [Servelec](https://www.servelec.co.uk/) and [the Yorkshire & Humber Cyber Crime Unit](https://www.yhrocu.org.uk/departments/regional-cyber-crime-unit/)

 🗣 Every year at [the UTC](https://github.com/UTCSheffield), with the exception of 2020, I have been an attendee and organiser of the northern cyber security convention [SteelCon](https://www.steelcon.info/) at the [Sheffield Hallam University](https://www.shu.ac.uk/) campus. Each year I create and deliver teaching resources, that lead onto completing an activity, then run it as an hour-long session for the [Kids Track](https://www.steelcon.info/the-event/kids-track/)

 🤖 I have also taken part in the [VEX Robotics competition](https://www.vexrobotics.com/v5/competition) every year and my team have successfully made it to the World final in Kentucky for 2020 (however the event was unfortunately cancelled) and the UK national competitions every year since starting

 🏆 Every year [the UTC](https://github.com/UTCSheffield) has held it's own internal CTF, with the exception of 2020, which I have managed to win each time

 🥇 I succesfully completed and earned my [Chief Scout's Gold Award](https://www.scouts.org.uk/top-awards/chief-scouts-gold-award/) whilst in Air Scouts before I progressed on to Explorer Scouts
